            <h2>Sensory Bottles</h2>

            <p>
                Our sensory bottles are crafted to engage children at every stage of their development. For infants and
                toddlers, they are a source of fascination and helping to enhance sensory awareness,
                calmness, and visual tracking.<br>
                As children grow, the bottles become tools for interactive play, such as "I Spy" games, color mixing,
                and
                sensory science experiments. They are also perfect for pretend play, providing endless possibilities for
                imaginative exploration.<br>
                With diverse themes and sensory experiences — float, sound, spy, move, and touch — they keep playtime
                vibrant
                and engaging, while supporting growth and exploration.</p>
